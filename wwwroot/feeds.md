# Feeds

Want to stay up-to-date about my writings? You can subscribe to my posts with any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator" rel="nofollow">feed reader</a>. I currently prefer <a href="https://inoreader.com" rel="nofollow">Inoreader</a> myself, but any will do. Below are some feeds provided by my website; you can also find links to more in-context in various other places.

I much prefer open Internet protocols where anyone can publish their work freely and independently, instead of isolated social media websites controlled by large corporations. In an age obsessed with information overload, I find old-school RSS feeds to be a breath of fresh air as a way of consuming news and opinion pieces at your own pace, as opposed to social media which can often be distracting or belligerent.

Tip for the technically-minded: By default all feed URLs return in RSS format, but you can also get them in Atom or [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org) format by adding an `.atom` or `.json` file extension to the URL, respectively.
